# Changelog for File-Tagger
The changelog for the **file-tagger** application started on 17.03.2022 by **reitherfuzi**.

## v1.0
- Started project with the `FileTaggerUtils` which allow to read/write and check user-defined attributes on all file-types.
- Added ``picocli`` as a maven-dependency to make an easy and nice command-line application/tool.
- Fully functional but very limited features, currently supported are only *reading*, *writing* and *deleting* of any user-defined attribute.
